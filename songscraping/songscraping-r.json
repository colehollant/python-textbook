called up this beer drinkin buddy of mine and said bill i aint havin a real good time he said why dont we go to the wrasslin matches and let off a little steamnow id never seen the matches before and by the time we reached that arena door the crowd was already backed up plumb out into the streetyeah people were pushin and shovin like cattle just gettin in line was a heck of a battle we had to fight like the devil but we finally got ringside seatswell we bought a program as we passed through the door went to section d seats 3 and 4 and about that time the announcer stepped into the ringhe said tonights the greatest card ever been signed we got a tagteam match thatll blow yer mind then they lowered the lights and the crowd began to screamhe introduced the spider from parts unknown with his trusty partner the blue cyclone they were takin on a team that never had been beatthen the ref checked em over and the rules were explained and somebody hollered the spiders got a chain then some old lady with blue hair fell right out of her seatwell they rang the bell and all hell broke loose my legs was shakin like a rubber goose id never seen anything like this not even in the warthe cyclone put the vulture in an airplane spin then he body slammed him and then he did it again i swear i didnt see how that ol boy could take much moreit was right about then in the thick of things that my buddy bill threw a chair in the ring and i knew wed better be headin for the doorcause i saw the cyclone lookin at us and he was rubbin his head and hes startin to cuss and i knew if he caught us hed break bills neck for surewell where we parked wasnt too far and bill ran so fast he beat me to the car locked the doors and wasnt about to let anyone inand i turned around and the cyclone was there and he said hey punk you forgot your chair and by the look in his eyes i knew that this was the endthen he body slammed me two or three times and he put his arms around me from behind then he piledrived me right there in the hard concretebroke both my arms and three of my ribs its the closest ive ever come to being killed and thats the last thing i remember fore he put me to sleepblue cyclone hes the meanest rascal the ring has ever known hell make you groan hell make you moan hell lay you prone and break your bones blue cyclonei woke up in a hospital bed stars acirclin around my head and a plaster cast on just about every bonebut the doctor said id be just fine these things just take a little time and three weeks later he let me go back homebut i laid in bed three weeks just thinkin i believe i coulda took him if i hadnt been drinkin so the next time we meet i wont be on no bingecause i hadnt been the same since we had that fight and id see that cyclone in my dreams at night and i wont be satisfied til i get revengewell the first thing my wife said when i got home was youd better leave that cyclone alone she said you might not be so lucky next timeso i says to her beg your pardon maam but it wasnt you who got the body slam then i changed the subject cause i done made up my mindthen i called up bill and told him my plan and all he said was right on man id do the same durn thing if itd been meit all happened so quick when that car door slammed it musta broke something cause the door locks jammed you was already down hes gone time i got freebill said since yer thinkin bout takin him again i know two ol boys who weigh 210 theyd wade through hell just to fight a circle sawthey both lift weights so you know theyre mean and the four of us would make a heck of a team we might not win but wed durnsure fight to a drawwell we talked it over they said theys willin theyd stop at nothing short of killin said hoss well back you as long as you wanna fightso i checked around at a few of the bars and found out where all the wrasslin stars hung out after the matches every wednesday nightwell i got there early the following week and found me a table where i could see the street and waited for the blue cyclone to hit the doorwell after a while he finally appeared sat down at the bar and ordered a beer and he barely took a sip fore i stepped to the middle of the floori yelled hey cyclone remember me im the guy you put to sleep only this time you can see im not alone ha hayou see them two big dudes over there the cyclone looked and said over where and i turned around and im a son of a gun they was gonethen the cyclone looked at me and grinned and he said okay punk here we go again it seems to me that some guys never learnand then he waded through them tables and chairs put a fullnelson on me and grabbed my hair and when he threw me to the floor i was starting to get concernedthen came a birrage of judo chops and i was beggin somebody to call the cops before the cyclone could commit a mortal crimei sure breathed a sigh of relief when i heard them ambulance sirens scream cause id be dead now if they hadnt gotten there on timethe next thing i remember they was carryin me in and the doctor said oh no you again i said doctor how long you thing itll be this timehe said boy if you dont leave that cyclone alone one of these days you aint goin

them to think that every single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within our books our music our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the priestsweve taken care of everything from words you read and to songs you sing the pictures that give pleasure to your eyes its one for all and all for one we work together common sons never need to wonder how or whywe are the priests of the temples of syrinx our great computers fill our hallowed halls we are the priests of the temples of syrinx all the gifts of life are held within our wallslook around this world we made equality our stock in trade come and join the brotherhood of man oh what a nice contented world let the banners be unfurled hold the red star proudly high in handwe are the priests of the temples of syrinx our great computers fill our hallowed halls we are the priests of the temples of syrinx all the gifts of life are held within our wallsiii discovery behind my beloved waterfall in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave i found it i brushed away the dust of the years and picked it up holding it reverently in my hands i had no idea what it might be but it was beautiful i learned to lay my fingers across the wires and to turn the keys to make them sound differently as i struck the wires with my other hand i produced my first harmonious sounds and soon my own music how different it could be from the music of the temples i cant wait to tell the priests about itwhat can this strange device be when i touch it it gives forth a sound its got wires that vibrate and give music what can this thing be that i foundsee how it sings like a sad heart and joyously screams out its pain sounds that build high like a mountain or notes that fall gently like raini cant wait to share this new wonder the people will all see its light let them all make their own music the priests praise my name on this nightiv presentation in the sudden silence as i finished playing i looked up o a circle of grim expressionless faces father brown rose to his feet and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall instead of the grateful joy that i expected they were words of quiet rejection instead of praise sullen dismissal i watched in shock and horror as father brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feeti know its most unusual to come before you so but ive found an ancient miracle i thought that you should knowlisten to my music and hear what it can do theres something here as strong as life i know that it will reach youyes we know its nothing new its just a waste of time we have no need for ancient ways the world is doing fineanother toy will help destroy the elder race of man forget about your silly whim it doesnt fit the plani cant believe youre saying these things just cant be true our world could use this beauty just think what we might do listen to my music and hear what it can do theres something here as strong as life i know that it will reach youdont annoy us further we have our work to do just think about the average  what use have they for youanother toy will help destroy the elder race of man forget about your silly whim it doesnt fit the planv oracle the dreami guess it was a dream but even now it all seems so vivid to me clearly yet i see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase i see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world i was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as i saw a completely different way to life a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago i saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these thingsi wandered home though the silent streets and fell into a fitful sleep escape to realms beyond the night dream cant you show me the lighti stand atop a spiral stair an oracle confronts me there he leads me on light years away through astral nights galactic daysi see the works of gifted hands that grace this strange and wondrous land i see the hand of man arise with hungry mind and open eyesthey left the planet long ago the elder race still learn and grow their power grows with purpose strong to claim the home where they belong home to tear the temples down home to changevi soliloquy i have not left this cave for days now it has become my last refuge in my total despair i have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now i can no longer live under the control of the federation but there is no other place to go my last hope is that with my death i may pass into the world of my dream and know peace at lastthe sleep is still in my eyes the dream is still in my head i heave a sigh and sadly smile and lie a while in bed i wish that it might come to pass not fade like all my dreams just think of what my life might be in a world like i have seen i dont think i can carry on carry on this cold and empty life oh no my spirits are low in the depths of despair my lifeblood spills overvii grand finale attention all planets of the solar federation attention all planets of the solar federation attention all

trace their way across the steely sky i used to think i had a pretty good life here just plugging into my machine for the day then watching templevision or reading a temple paper in the eveningmy friend jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the outer planets we have had peace since 2062 when the surviving planets were banded together under the red star of the solar federation the less fortunate gave us a few new moons i believed what i was told i thought it was a good life i thought i was happy then i found something that changed it alli overtureand the meek shall inherit the earthii temples of syrinx the massive grey walls of the temples rise from the heart of every federation city i have always been awed by them to think that every single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within our books our music our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the priestsweve taken care of everything from words you read and to songs you sing the pictures that give pleasure to your eyes its one for all and all for one we work together common sons never need to wonder how or whywe are the priests of the temples of syrinx our great computers fill our hallowed halls we are the priests of the temples of syrinx all the gifts of life are held within our wallslook around this world we made equality our stock in trade come and join the brotherhood of man oh what a nice contented world let the banners be unfurled hold the red star proudly high in handwe are the priests of the temples of syrinx our great computers fill our hallowed halls we are the priests of the temples of syrinx all the gifts of life are held within our wallsiii discovery behind my beloved waterfall in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave i found it i brushed away the dust of the years and picked it up holding it reverently in my hands i had no idea what it might be but it wasbeautiful  i learned to lay my fingers across the wires and to turn the keys to make them sound differently as i struck the wires with my other hand i produced my first harmonious sounds and soon my own music how different it could be from the music of the temples i cant wait to tell the priests about it what can this strange device be when i touch it it gives forth a sound its got wires that vibrate and give music what can this thing be that i foundsee how it sings like a sad heart and joyously screams out its pain sounds that build high like a mountain or notes that fall gently like raini cant wait to share this new wonder the people will all see its light let them all make their own music the priests praise my name on this nightiv presentation in the sudden silence as i finished playing i looked up to a circle of grim expressionless faces father brown rose to his feet and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall  instead of the grateful joy that i expected they were words of quiet rejection instead of praise sullen dismissal i watched in shock and horror as father brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feeti know its most unusual to come before you so but ive found an ancient miracle i thought that you should knowlisten to my music and hear what it can do theres something here as strong as life i know that it will reach youyes we know its nothing new its just a waste of time we have no need for ancient ways the world is doing fineanother toy will help destroy the elder race of man forget about your silly whim it doesnt fit the plani cant believe youre saying these things just cant be true our world could use this beauty just think what we might dolisten to my music and hear what it can do theres something here as strong as life i know that it will reach youdont annoy us further we have our work to do just think about the average  what use have they for youanother toy will help destroy the elder race of man forget about your silly whim it doesnt fit the planv oracle the dream i guess it was a dream but even now it all seems so vivid to me clearly yet i see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase  i see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world i was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as i saw a completely different way to life a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago i saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things i wandered home though the silent streets and fell into a fitful sleep escape to realms beyond the night dream cant you show me the lighti stand atop a spiral stair an oracle confronts me there he leads me on light years away through astral nights galactic daysi see the works of gifted hands that grace this strange and wondrous land i see the hand of man arise with hungry mind and open eyesthey left the planet long ago the elder race still learn and grow their power grows with purpose strong to claim the home where they belong home to tear the temples down home to changevi soliloquy i have not left this cave for days now it has become my last refuge in my total despair i have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now i can no longer live under the control of the federation but there is no other place to go my last hope is that with my death i may pass into the world of my dream and know peace at lastthe sleep is still in my eyes the dream is still in my head i heave a sigh and sadly smile and lie a while in bed i wish that it might come to pass not fade like all my dreamsjust think of what my life might be in a world like i have seen i dont think i can carry on carry on this cold and empty life oh nomy spirits are low in the
