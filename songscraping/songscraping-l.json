windows of the skull who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the terror through the wall who got busted in their pubic beards returning through laredo with a belt of marijuana for new york who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in paradise alley death or purgatoried their torsos night after night with dreams with drugs with waking nightmaresand so from being created in his likeness to being banished for wanting to be too much like him we were cast out and the garden of eden transformed in to the garden of evil los angeles the

everyday and everyday im trying you know how i can be less of a mess cuz you know he showed me look lauryn you know youre the problem ok im going to show you how youre causing the problem and now i want you to be the solution and thats what all of these songs are about just problem cause and solution free your mind its like we all think that the gospel is join and church building and thats deception you know the real gospel is repent which means let go of all that crap thats killin ya life was supposed to be a pleasurable experience not this torment you know and when i realized that i was tormenting myself it was about my lust it wasnt about things that i needed it was just you know all these security blankets i mean the more i acquired i became more of a prisoner i mean you know forty people on staff and you cant do nothing and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know youre supporting and carryin and you know its not good you know everybodya friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on its own bottom you know and in that respect we all get to do what our passion is see thats what praisin god is all about is doing your passion you know its not useless worthless ritual you know monotonous ritual where we just show up and cant wait to see the game you know its doing your passion and fulfilling your passion you know thats how were thankful thats how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive and im just glad that i you know i dont have to slave anymore you know cuz i music was my love and because of everything i thought had to accompany my music it became my burden it just got stolen from me i said what is this how did this thing that i love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something i loath and hate and so now you know i understand that it was because i was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasnt reality it wasnt the standard at all you know theres a scripture in the bible that we what does it say it says we compare ourselves amongst ourselves you know thats not the standard you already are the standard what are you trying to fit into a standard for we were each created to be individual standards you know and were trying to fit into a standard it doesnt make any sense you know so now im just you know after all that im just ready to be me and its a lot to work through you know because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about and its because we didnt understand you know because theres all this social doctrine that says you know that the infinite god with all this expression who created every single one of us absolutely different on purpose wants everybody to fit into the same suit but like you know thats deception thats deceptiontalking to someone offstage ok let me just i think this is the wrong one laughing i dont think this is the right onewe tookwe were in um florida this weekend and we took the kids to disneyworld and um you know we were going they gave us a tour they escorted us through the back and when they escorted us through the back we got to see how you know there all these people workin all hard and it was like real dirty back there and of course in the front it was all immaculately clean and i said i said you know people need to see the reality they need to see you know how these people slave to maintain this illusion and it felt like my life i said if people only knew what it was its like you know a bunch of musicians listen bustin their mm workin all hard to make it look easy whats the point you know oh uh i just threw this together uhaudience laughs you know its like you know what im sayin i mean you know slaving slaving to act like you know i wake up like this and none of us do you know none of us do none of us do and reality is good cuz that means everybody could just exhale let your belly out you know and chill you know but people get mad at me when i say look lets stop frontin and im saying you know thats the blessing now we can go around and look at each other and say oh you got one too and be free and we want to defend the curse ill tell ya that was not fun did it for a long time too longoffstage you didnt find it its another white one but you seein my purse or the the other bag or the green one ghetto you know its reality ok laughingone time it came to me you know i was just told very concretely you know it was like that voice the right one said to me he said lauryn you know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else i just want you to know that because we always thought we could get you know we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin the face and you know lookin hard in the video but you know reality isits like ive always told to my husband its like look you know we look at bob marley you know and we say ok lets just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content you see what im saying you cant get it from the outside in truth is from the inside out you know and the way weve been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical surface superficial temporary solution and im telling you true healing is from the inside out you know weve been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying offstage oh this is the oneboy ill tell ya god made him for me im something to put up with and to endure that is amazing ill be the first to tell you trust me yall could clap cuz thats some real work more clapping i was in there in the room you know before we came out here and he said to me i said ro should i change and he said yeah so i looked at him i said why did you tell me to change i was comfortable man but i asked him the question so i went in the room and i tried on all these clothes and i was like i feel like an idiot so i pulled out all these clothes and im sayin ok ro you know pack the bag neatly you know could you put the clothes back in and hes like alright so hes trying to do this but then im like no now take this out now put that back and take that out put that back hold that take that put the orange shoe the orange shoe so im like and then after awhile i just said ro baby could you leave please get out the room and i just put back on the clothes i came in ok i was likeim just not there anymore nah im telling you its like uh laughing hey you know hes learned because before we used to just beef and now hes like okayim out its real god gave us a brand new relationship man i mean one in truth you know its like we date people like lets say you know were interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again you understand what im sayin its likeand thats why so many marriages end up in divorce its because people wake up next to a stranger they say who the hell are you what are you doing in this bed wheres that man that used to do du dua and du and im sayin lets give them reality from the door becauseyoure going to attract love and the one that really loves you and then you dont have to pretend and falcify and you know keep that posture you know you know i cant im just like ill never forget when i first met him i said to him it was like he saw me eating in front of him and he told me he was like you eat like a man you must not like me you know because women usually they keep that posture and i said nah i said its not even that you know its but this is reality this is you know and thats it man i mean im just telling you its so wonderful to finally findand trust me its a work in progress its not something that happens overnight we all have to be introduced to each other im telling you i know that im up here and you see lauryn hill you came to see lauryn hill but this is the first time yall meet me you see what im saying dont think you met me before ok and as i grow youre going to meet me a little bit more youre gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more i can tell you i had to reintroduce myself to everybody i know my mother my father listen yall never knew me i want to introduce you to me im just getting to know me and you know what anything thats not growin is dead so we better be changing you know people would say to me they would hold me hostage and they seriously emotionally hostage and theyd say uh shes changing the moneys changing her and id say listen the moneys not changing me gods changing me im changing because thats a natural part of life were all supposed to change who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that nobody is let the experience teach you and be real man and umtheres gonna be warfare involved because theres some people who prefer deceptions see they say uh i dont like this new expression and i say what you want twothirds of me to stay outside im a whole person you cant say you know twothirds of lauryn come in here only twothirds is acceptable im a whole person you know and thats everybody you always talk about spiritual warfare and we didnt realize that it was in relationships its emotional warfare being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves and when they say hey that doesnt fit into our box for you we say well i aint in no box dont try to put me in one im going to play a little bit of guitar with this one but i might stop its cuz i really want you to listen to the words so if i stop you understand why i want you to really hear the words",

a white mother father that wasnt there addicted to crack cocaine alcohol and various other drugs same as his mom way way back so im gonna tell you about that right and im gonna tell you about how all this young boy ever wanted was happiness all he ever wanted was positivity all he ever wanted to do was entertain and this boy went through hell you gotta understand his mother was racist which is crazy cause how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men but you racist like bitch that dont make no sense but it is what it is you know he grew up her callin him a nigger the kids at school callin him a cracker identifying as black looking as white being told what you can or cant be this kid went through everything he went through he saw narcotics in the household violence murderers drug dealers he was kidnapped there was crazy shit that happened to this kid and he persevered while the whole world said what they said said you wouldnt be shit you aint gon be nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothing and i and he he said fuck that ima persevere and thats why the message is always peace love and positivity see he always saw things from two sides he always saw things from two sides he always knew that the message everybody was born equal regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation he knew that because he saw that take it back take it way back take it way because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated and that did not know and he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know these people that are ignorant that cannot see the bigger picture that must fight and kill and murder each other but once again all he ever wanted to do was spread a message of equality for every man woman and child regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first now imagine this child growing up and seeing the craziest shit being a part of the craziest shit running around with the wrong people running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and and all this because he didnt know he didnt know but he knew deep down in his heart that it wasnt right and he knew that he needed to get away from it now i want you to also imagine that at 17 years old this child okay leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings and then he would then come home to about eight or nine hours of sleep but spend four five six hours of that working on music persevering grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror and pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people just chanting his name hoping that it would happen but the but the but the world said no mothafucka little mothafucka nono nono nono nono ya nigga ya cracka ya white boy ya black mothafucka nono take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first and he said fuck that he said peace love and positivity he said equality for all man regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation yeah now i want you to also imagine people telling him that he did not live this life you just a white boy you aint never experienced that shit you from gaithersburg maryland nothing happens there oh no no we

of what people told him he was wasnt and would never be take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first black and that man is here today proud a lover of all human beings regardless of race religion color creed sexual orientation yeah yeah and hes here to say even though were all born and created equal we are not treated equally theres extremists on every side and you should just do

was low and therefore you a product of that and so your trauma is deep dont bury it you should weep and clean it out of your system then truly forgive em just my opinion only then can you find peace just start to notice happiness dont come from album release ive been through it before can only share with you what i know to be true but at the same time ill never be you and youll never be me no matter how hard that you try this is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly the truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky but if you want to then you ought to know why are you running from something with hopes of becoming someone thats finally worthy of love let me tell you now youre worthy enough fuck approval from strangers that shit is dangerous as hell find god learn to accept yourself and im gone accept him",

days on the negative energy of others remember that youre not your salary youre not your house youre not your car and no matter how big your bank account is your grave is six feet under just like everyone elses so enjoy the days you have worry not bout the days that came before you nor the ones that will follow you in death remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed and the fact that you are living is what life is all about so live your life to the fullest according to your happiness and the betterment of all kai damn man weve been walking forever thomas well thalias tracking system says well be there in just over an hourkai shit at least we got good walking music or is that it thomas oh no man im cueing up the fourth album now his final oneone two three four one two three four listen look into my eyes tell me you could see beyond the smile that im puttin on this front that im puttin up for you i spill my soul into a microphone with poems written in blood in hopes that its enough for you do you love me yet do you love me yet no okay ill go harder for you in fact i rap till i collapse all i wanted was acceptance my latest lesson ill never feel your approval till i accept my own come from a messed up home destitute and less informed about the ways to raise a child up to not become a product of his environment i need to cry and vent but i done built this wall up actin like everythings all good but in reality im lookin for something through bumpin my favorite rappers i came up after nas cole and hov eyes closed i zone till five or so in the morn im used to being alone shit you know how long ive been out on my own chasing dreams fantasies of a throne one day i wake up and see that it didnt exist all along till then i will pen verses that fans consider brilliant boosting my ego with every million that spills in and still then i wont find solace so wheres the logic in that worrying bout if they think logic could rap when it all goes back to a childhood need to be loved by parents that was in too deep with the drugs nigga my advice fuck the black and white shit be who you are identify as a star no one tells you youre that its something that you just know the world be stealing your glow your mama did what she could her life was miles from good your father fell in the trap they set for you when you black they met when they was low and therefore you a product of that and so your trauma is deep dont bury it you should weep and clean it out of your system then truly forgive em just my opinion only then can you find peace just start to notice happiness dont come from album release ive been through it before can only share with you what i know to be true but at the same time ill never be you and youll never be me no matter how hard that you try this is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly the truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky but if you want to then you ought to know why are you running from something with hopes of becoming someone thats finally worthy of love let me tell you now youre worthy enough fuck approval from strangers that shit is dangerous as hell find god learn to accept yourself and im gone accept him",
