not what my heart wants i want to be with you forever when i see the bright light past the long tunnel the warm memories we felt together always by my side letting me shine those smiles those tearsthat voice calling me ill keep my ears up for it that gaze searching for each other ill miss it even so what remains clear is the first flutter of lovewell meet again when the spring spreeze passes ill smile brightly when the spring breeze passeswell meet again when the spring spreeze passes ill hold you once more when the spring spreeze passes its thenim sorry im sorry i think ive always just been on the receiving on thank you thank you for being so beautiful you cover my empty heart filling it with youlaying your worn out hands on me letting me breathe only you now each and every day is my birthday im alive and reborn upalways by my side letting me shine those smiles those tearsyour familiar presence perhaps it might change the memories weve faced just the way they are what remains clear is the first flutter of lovewell meet again when the spring spreeze passes ill hold you once more when the spring spreeze passes its thenim not afraid we know each others hearts well dont worry because i care more about you than anyone elsewell meet again when the spring spreeze passes ill smile brightly when the spring breeze passeswell meet again when the spring spreeze passes ill hold you once more when the spring breeze passes its then",
