hoping that i can borrow a peace of mind im behind on whats really important my mind is really distorted i find nothing but trouble in my life im fortunate you believe in a dream this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine and last night was just another distraction or a reaction of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help held him like a newborn baby and made him feel like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will as blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive everybodys a victim in my eyes when i ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black a demon glued to my back whispering get em i got em and i aint give a fuck that same mentality that told my brother not to duck in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover the life that i knew as a youngn in pajamas and duntaduns when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb niggas like me never prosper prognosis of a problem child im proud and well devoted this piru shit been in me forever so

hormones just run away and if i can get em back to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught three niggas in one room first time i was tossed and im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain if you cant fit the pumps i walk in ill wait your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight ill probably live longer than you and never

sing about me promise that you will sing about me sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself am i really scared of passing away if its today i hope i hear a cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline reeking the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance with the other side may come soon and if im doomed may the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and im not sure why im infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wondering when imma rest and youre right your brother was a brother to me and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the tv screen by any means wasnt trying to offend or come between her personal life i was like it need to be told cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul exactly whatd happen if i aint continued rappin or steady being distracted by money drugs and four fives i count lives all on these songs look at the weak and cry pray one

sometimes i did the same abusing my power full of resentment resentment that turned into a deep depression found myself screaming in the hotel room i didnt wanna self destruct the evils of lucy was all around me so i went running for answers until i came home but that didnt stop survivors guilt going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned or maybe how a1 my foundation was but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned the word was respect just because you wore a different gang color than mines doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us but i dont know im no mortal man maybe im just another niggashit and thats all i wrote i was gonna call it another nigga but it aint really a poem i just felt like its something you probably could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground what you mean bout that what the ground representthe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evilrightthats how i see it my word is bond i seeand the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gonna be so fat they gonna be so appetising you know what im saying wealthy appetising the poor gonna be so poor and hungry you know what im saying its gonna be like there might be some cannibalism out this mutha they might eat the richaight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunitiesi see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word i took nothin i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company i changed everything i realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what im saying i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself you know what im saying i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for usand through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanityby my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true you know what im saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what im saying i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening so its no problem you know i mean its a problem but im not finna let them know im finna go straight throughwould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wallshit i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been threatened with resistance its been met with resistance and not only me but it goes down my family tree you know what im saying its in my veins to fight backaight well how long you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win and i wanna lay it all downin this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back cause once you turn 30 its like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you dont wanna fight no more and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth 30year old muthafuckasthats crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation todayi think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot theres gonna be like uh bloodshed for real i dont think america know that i think american think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing its gonna be murder you know what im saying its gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this muthafucka you know what im saying its gonna happenthats crazy man in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people dont understand how important it is sometimes i be like get behind a mic and i dont know what type of energy imma push out or where it comes from trip me out sometimesbecause the spirits we aint even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for usdamni wanted to read one last thing to you its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world it saysthe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him he can no longer see past his own thoughts hes trapped when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city the result wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the samewhats your perspective on that pac pac pac",
