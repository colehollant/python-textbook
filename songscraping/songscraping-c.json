before i left for camp i imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes i hadnt met yet running around all summer getting into trouble it turned out it would be me and just one girl thats you and were still at camp as long as were on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us were still wearing our orange camp tshirts we still smell like pineneedles i like you and you like me and i morethanlike you but i dont know if you do or dont morethanlike me youve never said so i havent been saying anything all summer content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on a girl whos smart and funny and who if i say something dumb for a laugh is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way i could never be a girl who reads books that no ones assigned to her whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet back in the real world we dont go to the same school and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood we wont go to the same high school so this is kind of it for us unless i say something and it might especially be it for us if i actually do say something the suns gone down and the bus is quiet a lot of kids are asleep were talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know and then im like can i tell you something and all of a sudden im telling you and i keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway and theres no expression on it and i think just after a point im just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you havent said yes or no yet and regrettably i end up using the word destiny i dont remember in what context doesnt matter before long im out of stuff to say and you smile and say okay i dont know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive and i would leave in order not to spoil the moment but theres nowhere to go because were on a bus so i pretend like im asleep and before long i really am i wake up the bus isnt moving anymore the domed lights that line the center aisle are all on i turn and youre not there then again a lot of kids arent in their seats anymore were parked at the pickup point which is in the parking lot of a methodist church the bus is half empty you might be in your dads car by now your bags and things piled high in the trunk the girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as i swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus just as one of them reaches my row it used to be our row on our way off its michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head adolescence is doing her a ton of favors bodywise she stops and looks down at me and her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so i cant really see her face but i can see her smile and she says one word destiny then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus i didnt know you were friends with them i find my dad in the parking lot he drives me back to our house and camp is over so is summer even though theres two weeks until school starts this isnt a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad this is a story about how i learned something and im not saying this thing is true or not im just saying its what i learned i told you something it was just for you and you told everybody so i learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always everybody cant turn around and tell everybody everybody already knows i told them but this means there isnt a place in my life for you or someone like you is it sad sure but its a sadness i chose i wish i could say this was a story about how i got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit but thats not true the truth is i got on the bus a boy and i never got off the bus i still havent",

questions in q and as so here it goes i know you were raised jehovahs witness but do you still follow any type of religion childishgambino i dont really believe in religion for myself ive become

title of clapping for the wrong reasons childishgambino its a semi famous quote robertf donald can you explain the greatness of sades debut album diamond life i would appreciate a very detailed explanation of why sade is so great and what she means to you as an artist if you refuse to answer this question i will take it to mean you do not enjoy the musical styling of sadeand as such you will draw my full ire 22 yo male who has just gotten heavily into sades music childishgambino i was literally listening to sade yesterday shes a world artist and her music is just in tune with whatever vibration we all run on i cant answer a lot of your questions about her all i can say is shes a special artistbeing maxgertler what does the ending of the last song symbolize like that life can end at

troll childishgambino they realize they dont need a leader fransoul dude you are awesome love your music and my question is do you ever see your self touring africa coz thats the only way i will ever see you unless you buy me a plane ticket to see you live in the us pliz respond childishgambino i really wanna see africa we were planning on south africa soon wiggitywackwes 1 there were huge jumps stylewise and sonically from camp to royalty to because the internet do you see yourself developing a signature sound or do you plan on keeping things experimental and constantly trying new sounds 2 your music has helped me through a lot and continues to so i just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for what you do thank you childishgambino thanks i always wanna experiment in everything ill always try to push myself i just never wanna be bored raybeach do you make things that have or message or do you just let people interpret it kind of like 3005 childishgambino i make things with messages for me in them i hope they translate sometimes they dont and thats fine but i usually just try to touch on something thats intangible for me basedgator question part what inspires you when it comes to production i hear a lot of tradtional trap drums and sounds on the new album which make sense since your from the south but you didnt really do that on camp then you got something like zealots of stockholm where it gets death gripish is it as simple as your just finding the right sound for the lyrics or do you draw from other things since your probably not going to seerespond to this let me stan a little bit haha stan part you are my role model i can identify with your life and lyrics so well its crazy i really hope in 10 years i can be as successful and well respected as you i already liked your comedy and acting but ever since i found out you rapped and i heard that ee cummings line in freaks and geeks i was hooked anyway the new album is dope as heck great work as always sir and i cant wait to see what you do in the futurechildishgambino ha thanks i try not to think to hard about whats trap drums whats influenced by whos hot now and all that i try to just find what feels honest cause i dont know if id wanna hear a song that was considered entire original by everyone but was no fun to make this album tho it came from a messy place was by far the most fun to make savvyrja it sounds like you are influecnced by john lennon quite alot care to elaborate childishgambino to be honest i dont know much about him i was always a beach boys dude over beatles i learned a little about him through jhene savvyrja who is your favorite artist outside of hiphop perosnally gorillaz or red hot chilli peppers childishgambino anything by sam cooke griffinmahon do you think there is more room for expression or creativity in short films as opposed to fulllength movies does this translate to the relationship between mixtapes and albums in rap childishgambino short films just fit normal people a little better time is ultimate currency we dont have a lot of time to spend a short film for me leaves more to the audience and doesnt take so much time and if its free then you really have no excuse not to watch it and at least have an opinion flowmatic whats your perspective on camp looking back at it now  childishgambino i love camp it theres little things id change cause i know how music better but yeah i does what its supposed to do flytendencies how do you sing so beautifully childishgambino thats what you call it a1day did my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and yeezuss sound play a role in because the internet how big of a influence is kanye to you childishgambino i guess it influenced me as much as it influenced all music to be better but honestly his whole steez isnt for me i cant do that he just inspires me to be limitless stefanponce can you break down the song to boy band  childishgambinomyh how can mirrors be real if our eyes arent real childishgambino mirrors arent real metron whats the biggest opportunity that you could have taken but you missed out on in your life did you explain the abrupt ending on life the biggest
