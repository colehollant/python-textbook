long the consequences deadly cant visualize myself as nothing but a criminal control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal cause young niggas is hard headed they letting off full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause aint no coming back family dressed in black plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me like i aint the one who put them jays on her feet like i aint out in the field like that i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless screaming fuck the law my life is lawless thats what you call it aint got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven this is hell and i dont mean that hyperbolic i try to find employment even if the swiper chargeless but these felonies be making life the hardest resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it thats why i write this sonnet if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it let her know my life is on it for your eyes let her know my life is on for your eyes onlyfor your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand meyoure probably grown now so this songll hit you if youre hearing this it means unfortunately im no longer with you in the physical not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive he got me praying that the spiritual is real so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too so i know how part of you feels maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me i hope not im tired of dope spots and fiends that smoke rocks ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot im writing this cause me and the devil had a dance i see death round the corner apologizing in advance dont know if i ever had a chance at a glance im a failure addicted to pushing paraphernalia but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight years my pops shot up drug related mama addicted so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging blood was staining the concrete older niggas i loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet that slow money picked up the family business by the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence round the same time you came in this world me and your mama thinking what the fuck we naming this girl i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was nineteen it took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me and now its too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that were never set for me im living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps catching up to me and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand mein several ways i couldve went out too many to count was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout was it the young nigga blasting frustrated cause the cash running out niggas dont know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed my views misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the shit i learned from in the streets was true that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you they just pull up on your street let the heat have you and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you into a box where your son dont even know his pops and the cyclical nature of doing time continues my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon and sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true but maybe theres a chance that its not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels and i can teach you this in person like im teaching you to tie your own shoes i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you for your eyes onlyfor your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understandone day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling he said jermaine i knew since we was children i never asked for nothing when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me i dealt with the repercussions of my actions i know you tried to steer me away from that shit but that shit was in my blood you know my life i know your momma nigga send my love in case i never get a chance to speak again i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib thats the way i wished my family lived but my granny crib was in the jects i had to interject like nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions but ive been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow like the time im living on is borrowed with that said im proud to say i was a father write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready so im leaving you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch it disrespect it this perspective is a real one another lost ville son i dedicate these words to you and all the other children affected by all the mass incarceration in this nation that sent your pops to prison when he needed education sometimes i think this segregation wouldve done us better although that means i would never be brought into this world cos my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesborough with little zach and cole world barely one years old now its thirty years later making sure the storys told girl your daddy was a real nigga not cos he was cold not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old not becuase he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues not cause he went from bagging up them grams to serving os now your daddy was a real nigga not cos he was hard not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars not because he screamed fuck the law although that was true your daddy was a real nigga cos he loved you for your eyes only",
