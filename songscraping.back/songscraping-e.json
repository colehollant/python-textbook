reall sad the way they said goodbye or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldnt cry he packed his things walked out the door and drove away and she became the girl from yesterday he took a plane across the sea to some foreign land she stayed at home and tried to understand how someone who had been so close could be so far away and she became the girl from yesterday she doesnt know whats right she doesnt know whats wrong she only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long and she doesnt count the teardrops that shes cried while hes away because she knows deep in her heart that hell be back someday the lights on in the window shes waiting by the phone talking to a memory thats never coming home she dreams of his returning and the things that he might say but shell always be the girl

learn to be still learn to be still now the flowers in your garden they dont smell so sweet maybe youve forgotten the heaven lying at your feet solo there are so many contridictions in all these messages we send we keep asking how do i get out of here where do i fit in though the world is torn and shaken even if your heart is breakin its waiting for you to awaken and someday you will learn to
